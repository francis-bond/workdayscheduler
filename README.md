User can input their notes and save them to their timeblocks.

## Development

This project was a great way for me to solidify concepts that we had previously. I had more that a few "aha" moments where concepts clicked.

Overcoming the bugs and getting clarity on concepts made this the most satisfying project to finish so far.
